# Nearest-Neighbor-Algorithm
This is an implementation of the nearest neighbor algorithm that given a set of points in the plane, finds the smallest distance between 2 points. This is a divide and conquer algorithm and is implemented in python.
This was an assignment for my CS 141 (Intermediate Data Structure and Algorithms) course.

To run the program:
Go to the directory where this file is located using the command line. Then type in the command "python nearest_neighbor.py input.txt". The input.txt contains the points that are fed into the program and are formatted in a specific way.
